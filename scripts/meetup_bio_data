"This group is here to inform like-minded musicians about Devin Bews weekly jam (1st three Sundays of each month) at the SeaMonster Lounge in Wallingford, Seattle. This jam is unique because the process in which we produce the jams is based on Bews live-recorded samples of the musicians on stage. This gives any musician a chance to play some sounds that they are working on in a venue setting and have it flipped by a producer in real time for a unique take on their sounds filtered through anothers interpretation. Id like to have musicians who play be aware of their natural tendencies to slip into what is comfortable and to stretch their focus to the next step away from that comfort. With the primary mechanic being discovery of a concept or motif, the function is also to latch onto an idea and to nurture it into existence. Its easy to play what is familiar and comfortable, but an exciting challenge to take it to the next level!Great place to bring friends for cheap drinks and hang out whi",nightlife
