"What were aboutPublic GroupThe idea is simple ‚Äì just getting together a few people to see plays and independent / interesting films, in Miami. You don‚Äôt need to be local ‚Äì we have people from near and far. For each outing there will be plans to have something to eat or drink beforehand or afterward ‚Äì do join in. Key places are:‚Ä¢ theatres ‚Äì Regal Theaters on Lincon Road, New World Symphony Hall on 17th Street, Fillmore ‚Ä¢ cinemas ‚Äì the Tower, O Cinema in WynwoodNumbers really count in this group as events are small enough to be friendly and to integrate new people. This works by having members commit to turning up when they RSVP, and not coming unless they‚Äôre RSVPed. It means when you come you‚Äôll get a seat for dinner/drinks (because no one will have gate-crashed and taken it) ‚Äì and you‚Äôll meet lots of interesting people (because they will turn up!)When you join this group an RSVP is a promise to turn up (and stay for the social part of the event), and joining is a promise to come only if you‚Äôre RSVPed.There‚Äôs no requirement to attend any particular number of events with the group, or to pay anything to join.If you‚Äôre thinking of sending me a message promoting an event, then unless it‚Äôs a local play/film and either heavily discounted or includes a director/writer/cast Q&A, don‚Äôt ‚Äì thanks. This is a zero-spam group ‚Äì I keep faith with members by circulating nothing except legitimate event details.",beach
